Projects in my Second Year Project Course
These proejcts are written in C and 8051 assembly, and were used to control a reflow oven microcontroller (built by hand by us)
to solder various breadboards, then control those breadboards (built by us) to control an electromagnetic tether robot.
This robot would follow our instructions autominously, via magnetic field lines and command buttons.
